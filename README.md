# Why?

Amazon doesn't give us an API for retrieving product customer reviews.
Often while browsing other websites I need to copy paste the product
name and input that into Amazon in order to know the rating.

I understand why Amazon doesn't enable such an API -- if you're on
Amazon's site, you're more likely to buy the thing with One-Click,
so here's my solution.

# Userscripts

Comes with a Frys.com userscript that makes use of the API/service
